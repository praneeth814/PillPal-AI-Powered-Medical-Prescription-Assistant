# PillPal

## AI Powered Medical Prescription Assistant

---

## 1. Project Overview

PillPal is a web-based intelligent system developed to simplify medical prescription interpretation and assist users in managing medication schedules effectively. The system integrates machine learning techniques with web technologies to structure prescription data and generate organized medication instructions.

This project was developed as part of an academic/internship requirement to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning and full-stack development concepts in solving real-world healthcare problems.

---

## 2. Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To process and structure prescription-related data.
* To apply machine learning techniques for intelligent data handling.
* To generate clear and organized medication instructions.
* To develop a web-based interface that connects users with backend ML logic.
* To demonstrate end-to-end integration of data processing, model deployment, and web application development.

## 3. Problem Statement

Medical prescriptions often contain complex terminology and dosage patterns that may not be easily interpretable. Patients may struggle to understand medication schedules, which can result in incorrect usage.

This project aims to provide a structured and systemized approach to managing prescription-related data through automated processing and intelligent logic implementation.

## 4. Technologies Used

### Programming Language

* Python

### Backend Framework

* Flask

### Machine Learning and Data Processing

* Pandas – Data manipulation and structuring
* Scikit-learn – Model development and prediction logic
* Pickle – Model serialization and loading

### Frontend

* MERN Stack components (where applicable)
* Bootstrap – Responsive UI design

### Development Environment

* PyCharm IDE

## 5. System Architecture

The workflow of the system is structured as follows:

1. User interacts with the web interface.
2. Input data is sent to the Flask backend.
3. Data preprocessing is handled using Pandas.
4. The trained machine learning model (Scikit-learn) processes the input.
5. The model is loaded using Pickle for efficient deployment.
6. Processed output is returned and displayed through the frontend interface.

This modular architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation between frontend, backend, and ML components.

## 6. Implementation Details

* Data handling and transformation were implemented using Pandas.
* Machine learning logic was developed using Scikit-learn.
* The trained model was serialized using Pickle to enable efficient deployment without retraining.
* Flask was used to integrate the ML model with the web interface.
* Bootstrap was used to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design.
